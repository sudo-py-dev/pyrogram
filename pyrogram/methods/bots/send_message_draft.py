        """Sends a draft for a being generated text message.

        Use this method to stream a partial message to a user while the message is being generated. This method shows a live text preview as it is being composed. To achieve a smooth
        AI-streaming effect, call this method repeatedly with progressively longer text, passing a consistent *draft_id* for all frames of the same stream.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier of the target chat.

            draft_id (``int``):
                Unique identifier of the message draft; must be non-zero. Changes of drafts with the same identifier are animated.

            text (``str``):
                Text of the message to be sent, 1-4096 characters after entities parsing.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                Mode for parsing entities in the message text. By default, texts are parsed using Markdown and HTML styles.

            entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`, *optional*):
                List of special entities that appear in the text, which can be specified instead of **parse_mode**.

            message_thread_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier for the target message thread.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: On success, True is returned.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the text is empty or the chat type is not a private chat.
            :obj:`~pyrogram.errors.RPCError`: In case of a Telegram RPC error.

        Example:
